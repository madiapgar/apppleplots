Description: This package contains all generated plots for the study on the effects of dietary fiber
             and fat on the gut microbiome and metabolites it produces in the context of antibiotic-associated C. difficile infection
             done by the Lozupone lab at CU Anschutz. This package also includes base functions to create plots similar to those 
             generated and to run nonparametric pairwise comparisons/linear regression analysis.
